# Personal Banking
My project to visualize movements on my accounts.

Story: I have accounts in multiple banks. I would like to see balances for all of them in one place.
Originaly I had Excel worksheet with VB macros, but it needs Office and I don't have it anymore.
There are probably other more powerful tools for my requirements but it's fun project and I am learning a lot.
